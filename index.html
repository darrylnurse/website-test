    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="body-paragraph">I am a student at CUNY York college and an aspiring Fullstack Developer, at least for now.
      <br>My goal has changed a few times over my career as a student, as the more I learn, the more I want to learn, create and become.</p>
    <p class="body-paragraph">I love art, and imbue this passion into my designs, whether it is a magnificent website, clean, beautiful code or a gorgeous picture.</p>

  <section id="projects">
    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <p class="body-paragraph">Currently, I have no major completed projects.
      <br>There are things I have worked on that exist within my local system, but they are not yet worthy of exhibition.</p>
